h1. Wet Hive theme for the Textpattern Content Management System

Copyright (C) 2013-2016 Robert Wetzlmayr

This theme demonstrates how to amend and customize "Hive", one of the core admin-side themes.

It serves as a starting point for your own customizations and is not meant to be complete (or aesthetically pleasing).

You customizations are stored separately from the core theme and will thus survive any updates to core.

h3. Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Can I change the 'wet_hive' name to something else?
A: Yes. Just rename both the directory /textpattern/theme/wet_hive and the file /textpattern/theme/wet_hive/wet_hive.php to your liking.

Q: Can I add more than one style sheet, remove the 'Roboto' font, or add a custom Javascript file to the <head>?
A: Yes. Look into the html_head() function in wet_hive.php.

Q: How can I uninstall this theme?
A: Change the admin-side theme to something else, then delete the /textpattern/theme/wet_hive directory.
