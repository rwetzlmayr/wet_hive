h1. Wet Hive theme for the Textpattern Content Management System

Copyright (C) 2013-2016 Robert Wetzlmayr

This theme demonstrates how to amend and customize "Hive", one of the core admin-side themes.

It serves as a starting point for your own customizations and is not meant to be complete (or aesthetically pleasing).

You customizations are stored separately from the core theme and will thus survive any updates to core.
